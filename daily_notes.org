*** Analyzers
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/analysis-intro.html
- When we index a document, its full-text fields are analyzed
 into terms that are used to create the inverted index.

*** Mapping

- Match value of each field in document to certain data type

*** Document
- A /key/ is the name of a field or property, and a /value/ can be a string, a number ....
- A document also has /metadata/ -- information about the document.
- Documents are /indexed/ -- stored and made searchable -- by using the index API.

*** Sorting and Relevance
- By default, results are returned sorted by /relevance/ -- with the most relevant docs first.

*** Doc Values Intro
- When searching, we need to be able to map a term to a list of documents.
- When sorting, we need to map a document to its terms. We need to 'uninvert' the inverted index.
- Doc vaules are created at index-time: when a field is indexed, ElasticSearch adds the tokens to the 
inverted index for search. But it also extracts the terms and adds them to the doc values.

*** Workflow I know so far
1. Use ICONEngine to parse input to get concepts
2. Use ElasticSearch on wiki pages (leading paragraphs) with concepts to select possible wiki pages
3. Use ElasticSearch on Pubmed (abstract) with wiki titles to select possible papers.

*** TODO 
- Understand how ICON extract concepts from input

*** Possible places to improve
- Some concepts are meaningless

  - topic keywords (come from ICON or regex?)
- Use simple elastic query

*** Comments on the code
- Run pipeline from ICON

- TopicAnalyser.topicCreator ::
  - TopicAnalyser.topicKeyConceptsCreator1 :: 
    - use ElasticSearch to get wiki pages from key concepts
    - return KeyConcept - a mapping from key concept to a list of diagnoses (aka wiki pages)
  - TopicANalyser.topicDiagnosesCreator1 ::
    - concept_score comes from ICON
    - calculate diagnosis score based on concept_score
    - filter diagnosis based on demographic info (WikiSearcher.filterByDemographic)
    - there is a mapping from disorder to gender
  - generate keywords for treatment
  - generate keywords for tes

*** UIMA
- An /Analysis Engine/ is a program that analyzes artifacts (e.g. documents) and infers information
from them.
- An annotator is a component that contains analysis logic.
- Annotators produce their analysis results in the form of typed /Feature Structures/, which has
simple data structures that have a type and a set of (attribute, value) pairs.
- All feature structures, including annotations, are represented in the UIMA
 /Common Analysis Structure (CAS)/

*** use batch training to speed up training process
- this reduces the variance in the parameter update and can lead to more stable convergence
- this allows the computation to take advantage of highly optimized matrix operations that 
should be used in a well vectorized computation of the cost and gradient
- One important point regarding SGD is the order in which we present the data to the algorithm
- If the data is given in some meaningful order, this can bias the gradient and lead to poor convergence. 
Generally a good method to avoid this is to randomly shuffle the data prior to each epoch of training.
